Thanks for testing this alpha firmware updater! This only works on PC at the moment.

This is a program called avedude.exe which will flash an arduino hex file across to the arduino chip inside genajam.

Firstly, make sure that you don't have any other arduino devices plugged via USB into your computer.

Unzip the file to a directory on your hard drive and run the batch file 'genajam firmware update.bat'.

Hopefully it will give you an update prompt and you'll see it flashing on to the arduino.
